# Jekyll Theme for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)

Jekyll Starter Theme for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)

Starting point is creating a making AMP pages in Jekyll where it will be simple and time saving to redesign and update the code by separation of concerns and Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). 

I also wanted to make it as simple as possible to add new pages that are SEO- and AMP-ready without having to edit too much code. Automation of optionally adding inline Schema JSON-LD of the currently supported by AMP: Article, NewsArticle, BlogPosting, VideoObject (Source).
